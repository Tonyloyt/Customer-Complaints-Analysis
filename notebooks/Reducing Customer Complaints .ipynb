    "# Reducing Customer Complaints: Targeted Call Campaign Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers of our store have been complaining regularly on social media posts, in an effort to reduce the number of complaints, we have decided to start a campaign to call our customers who are more likely to complain, in order to collect their opinions on how to serve them better. Using transaction history for the last 30 days, create a machine learning model using python to predict whether the customer will complain by the end of the month or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to effectively reduce the number of customer complaints for our store by implementing a targeted campaign to engage customers who are more likely to complain. By proactively reaching out to these customers and gathering their opinions, we aim to enhance our understanding of their concerns and preferences, leading to improved service and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Objectives:\n",
    "- Identify customers who are more likely to complain based on relevant factors from transaction data for the last 30 days.\n",
    "- Develop a machine learning model to predict customers complaint likelihood for the call campaign.\n",
    "- Engage customers through personalized phone calls to collect their feedback, suggestions, and opinions on how to better serve them.\n",
    "- Address customer concerns promptly and resolve any outstanding complaints raised during the calls.\n",
    "- Analyze the feedback received and identify common themes, issues, and areas for improvement.\n",
    "- Take necessary actions based on customer feedback to enhance our products, services, or processes.\n",
    "- Monitor and track the impact of the call campaign by measuring the reduction in customer complaints and improvements in customer satisfaction ratings.\n",
    "- Continuously iterate and refine the campaign strategy to optimize its effectiveness over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that by leveraging transaction history data from the last 30 days and building a machine learning model in Python, it is possible to predict whether a customer will submit a complaint by the end of the month. We anticipate that certain patterns and characteristics within the transaction history can serve as indicators of a customer's likelihood to complain. By accurately identifying customers who are more likely to complain, we can proactively reach out to them through a targeted call campaign and gather their opinions to enhance our service and mitigate potential complaints."

    "- Distribution of customer age, the histogram of customer age distribution reveals interesting insights. The majority of customers fall below the age of 55, indicating a relatively younger customer base. Suggesting a higher concentration of younger customers. This information can be useful for targeting specific age segments in the call campaign, as different age groups may have different complaint patterns and preferences."

    "## Conclusion & Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Our goal was to reduce the number of customer complaints by identifying customers who are more likely to complain and collecting their opinions to improve our services. We approached this problem by creating a machine learning model starting with `Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, `Light Gradient Boosting Model` & `CatBoost` after evaluation analyisis we opt to stick with `Random Forest Classifier`, by looking on the predictive power fits well with our goal of capturing well customers more likely to complain and Minimize the risk of miss targeting predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, we trained our Classifier on the transaction history data for the last 30 days. The model was able to predict the likelihood of customer complaints with an accuracy of 82.9%, F1-score of 86% and an AUC score of 81.1%\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix provided detailed insights into the model's performance. We observed that the model correctly predicted 1842 instances of customers who did not complain (True Negative) and 3454 instances of customers who complained (True Positive). However, there were 727 cases of customers who complained but were not predicted (False Negative), and 362 cases of customers who did not complain but were predicted to complain (False Positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "The AUC curve demonstrated the model's ability to discriminate between customers who complained and those who did not. With an AUC score of 0.88, the model exhibited good predictive power and performed significantly better than random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the feature importances provided insights into the factors that contributed most to predicting customer complaints. The top contributing features included the balance on the complaint date, the amount deposited via card, the quantity of items purchased, and the customer's age. These features played a crucial role in identifying customers more likely to complain and can be used to prioritize targeted efforts for improving customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explainability is a crucial aspect of our machine learning predictions to understand the factors contributing to customer complaints. We employed the `Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)` technique. LIME provides interpretability by generating local explanations for individual predictions. By utilizing LIME, we were able to generate feature importance explanations for specific customer instances, highlighting the key factors that influenced their complaint likelihood. These explanations enable us to gain insights into the decision-making process of our model and understand the specific features driving the predictions. This approach enhances the transparency and interpretability of our model, empowering us to make informed decisions and take targeted actions to improve customer satisfaction and mitigate complaints\n",
    "\n",
    "Our machine learning model based on Random Forest Classifier proved effective in predicting customer complaints. By utilizing this model, we can proactively identify customers who are more likely to complain and focus our efforts on addressing their concerns. This approach enables us to collect valuable feedback, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately reduce the number of complaints, leading to improved overall service quality and customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improve data collection: Consider collecting more detailed and comprehensive data related to customer transactions, interactions, and feedback. This additional data can provide deeper insights into customer behavior and preferences, enabling more accurate predictions and targeted campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Scaling & Explore additional features: Normalising the range of features because are varying in degrees of magnitude, range and units. Experiment with generating new features based on the existing data to capture more information about customer behavior and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Incorporate external data sources: Look for relevant external data sources that can complement the existing transaction history. This may include demographic data, social media sentiment analysis, or customer satisfaction surveys. Integrating such data can provide a more comprehensive view of customer preferences and help identify potential areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Regular model retraining: Customer behavior and preferences can evolve over time, so it is important to regularly update and retrain the predictive model. Set up a system to periodically retrain the model using the latest transaction data to ensure it stays accurate and up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Collaborate with customer service: Establish a strong feedback loop with the customer service team to gather insights from direct customer interactions. Regularly communicate the findings and recommendations from the predictive model to customer service representatives, enabling them to provide better support and tailored solutions to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Continuously monitor and evaluate: Implement a system to track the performance of the call campaign and customer satisfaction metrics over time. Regularly monitor the impact of the campaign and make necessary adjustments to improve its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these recommendations can enhance our customer complaint management strategy and further reduce the number of complaints. This will not only result in improved customer satisfaction but also help build a positive brand reputation and foster long-term customer loyalty."
